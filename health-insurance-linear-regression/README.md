#  Health Insurance Charges Prediction

This project applies **Linear Regression** to predict medical insurance charges based on personal and lifestyle factors.

<br>

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle â€“ Medical Cost Personal Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance)  
- **Features**:
  - `age` â€“ Age of the primary beneficiary  
  - `sex` â€“ Male / Female  
  - `bmi` â€“ Body mass index  
  - `children` â€“ Number of children covered by insurance  
  - `smoker` â€“ Smoking status  
  - `region` â€“ Residential area in the US  
- **Target**: `charges` â€“ Individual medical costs billed by health insurance  

<br>

## Steps
1. Encoding categorical variables
2. Splitting into train/test sets  
3. Training a Linear Regression model  
4. Model evaluation using **RÂ² score**  
5. Visualization of **Actual vs. Predicted** charges 

<br>

## Results
- **RÂ² score**: ~0.78 (varies by split)  
- Sample predictions:
  - 20-year-old non-smoker â†’ *2859.60792468*  
  - 50-year-old male, BMI 35 â†’ *11262.64453948*
