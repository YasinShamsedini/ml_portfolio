#  K-Means Clustering – Wholesale Customers

This project applies **K-Means Clustering** to segment wholesale customers based on their annual spending on *Milk* and *Grocery*.

<br>

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Wholesale Customers Dataset (UCI)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wholesale+customers)  
- Features used in this project:  
  - `Milk`  
  - `Grocery`  
- Goal: Cluster customers into groups with similar purchase behavior

<br>

## Steps
1. Load dataset  
2. Select two features (`Milk` and `Grocery`)  
3. Apply **K-Means Clustering** with `k=3`  
4. Visualize clusters and cluster centers  

<br>

## Results
- Customers are divided into 3 distinct clusters  
- White stars (`*`) represent cluster centers  
- Visualization shows clear segmentation based on purchase amounts

<br>

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

<br>

✍️ *This project demonstrates unsupervised learning and customer segmentation with K-Means using real-world purchase data.*
